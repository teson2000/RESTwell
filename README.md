# RESTwell

> _REST without regrets._

**RESTwell** is a pragmatic specification for building structured, extensible, and maintainable REST APIs — without the ambiguity of loosely typed query parameters, route spaghetti, or poorly scoped intents.

Created by [Tjelvar Eriksson](https://your-website-or-github-here), RESTwell aims to refine REST API design with just enough structure to stay sane at scale, without getting in the way of developer productivity.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Casing-based disambiguation** between API control and data fields (finally fix the `offset` problem).
- 📦 **Resource key encoding** that supports natural and composite keys cleanly.
- 🚦 **Intent and View routes** for non-CRUD actions and advanced server-side queries.
- 🛠️ **Strict semantics** for PATCH vs PUT, and pragmatic versioning via hostname.
- 📎 Optional support for HATEOAS, enums, ETags, binary uploads, and field filtering.
- 🔧 Agnostic to language or framework.
